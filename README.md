# WordCatch
WordCatch is a webapp which helps non-native English speaker learn English. It gives users a few word candidates to fill in an incomplete phrase. For example, when a user typing "different _ them", our webapp will prompt out the following candidates: "different from them", "different than them", "different to them", "different about them" etc, each with five example sentences. It also supports filtering by part of speech. When a user typing "v. an issue", it will prompt out candidates like "submit an issue", "have an issue", etc.
